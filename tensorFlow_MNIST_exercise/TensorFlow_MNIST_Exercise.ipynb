    "There are several main adjustments you may try.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to take note of the time it takes the algorithm to train. This will provide you with an additional level of understanding. That is also your first task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the code from the lecture as the basis, fiddle with the hyperparameters of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The *width* (the hidden layer size) of the algorithm. Try a hidden layer size of 200. How does the validation accuracy of the model change? What about the time it took the algorithm to train? Can you find a hidden layer size that does better?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The *depth* of the algorithm. Add another hidden layer to the algorithm. This is an extremely important exercise! How does the validation accuracy change? What about the time it took the algorithm to train? Hint: Be careful with the shapes of the weights and the biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The *width and depth* of the algorithm. Add as many additional layers as you need to reach 5 hidden layers. Moreover, adjust the width of the algorithm as you find suitable. How does the validation accuracy change? What about the time it took the algorithm to train?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fiddle with the activation functions. Try applying sigmoid transformation to both layers. The sigmoid activation is given by the method: tf.nn.sigmoid()\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Fiddle with the activation functions. Try applying a ReLu to the first hidden layer and tanh to the second one. The tanh activation is given by the method: tf.nn.tanh()\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Adjust the batch size. Try a batch size of 1000. How does the required time change? What about the accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Adjust the batch size. Try a batch size of 1. That's the SGD. How do the time and accuracy change? Is the result coherent with the theory?\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Adjust the learning rate. Try a value of 0.0001. Does it make a difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Adjust the learning rate. Try a value of 0.02. Does it make a difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Combine all the methods above and try to reach a validation accuracy of 98.5+ percent.\n",

    "## Deep Neural Network for MNIST Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll apply all the knowledge from the lectures in this section to write a deep neural network. The problem we've chosen is referred to as the \"Hello World\" for machine learning because for most students it is their first example. The dataset is called MNIST and refers to handwritten digit recognition. You can find more about it on Yann LeCun's website (Director of AI Research, Facebook). He is one of the pioneers of what we've been talking about and of more complex approaches that are widely used today, such as covolutional networks. The dataset provides 28x28 images of handwritten digits (1 per image) and the goal is to write an algorithm that detects which digit is written. Since there are only 10 digits, this is a classification problem with 10 classes. In order to exemplify what we've talked about in this section, we will build a network with 2 hidden layers between inputs and outputs."
